    Stellar Vacation is the company to choose for space travel and tourism.
</p>
<p>
    Our company, Stellar Vacation, is revolutionizing space tourism. We bring people up to space to stay in our luxurious space hotel. We provide personal trainers for all of our visitors to stay fit and adapt to space. Our hotel has the latest technology and amenities, including artificial gravity made by a centrifuge. Staying in our hotel lets you be able to experience everything an astronaut does, the amazing views with fewer health risks. You are still able to relax and experience the wonders of being off of our planet without worry.
</p>
<p>
    All of our rooms are equipped with our own A.I., “David”. David can help with any questions or needs you may have while you stay here. In your room, you have wall-to-wall TV screens that can actively broadcast the sights outside of the hotel, so you will always get the immersion of having windows and being able to see all of the views. It is truly a once in a lifetime experience.
</p>
<p>
    Our Hotel is themed with lots of beautiful galaxy murals, and art of stars all around. The rooms have lots of dark colors to make it seem like you're surrounded by space, though it does come with all the technology you need with USB chargers in every room and device-integrated TVs, with Wifi. 
</p>
<p>
    We offer a full stargazing area, equipped with telescopes to better allow you to see all the things space has to offer that you normally can't see on Earth. Chambers where the artificial gravity is turned off, and you are able to experience the low gravity that surrounds the hotel! To go along with that we have zero-gravity obstacle courses so you can test your skills without gravity!
</p>
<p>
    We serve all three meals of the day, with multiple options each meal to accommodate for any allergies. Food that astronauts eat is also available to try!
