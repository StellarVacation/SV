    Incase of an emergency during launch the launch escape system (LES) will activate. The LES consists of rockets attached to the crew capsule on the rocket. Incase of emergency all engines will cut and the capsule will detach while the LES activates. This will launch the capsule a safe distance away from the rocket before deploying parachutes.
